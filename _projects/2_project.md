At **QHack 2024**, we developed and trained **Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs)** for identifying quantum phases of matter.

**Highlights:**
- Trained on a GPU-accelerated quantum circuit simulator for rapid prototyping
- Evaluated robustness on **IonQ's real quantum hardware** through AWS Braket
- Won **3rd place** in the "A Matter of Taste" challenge and the **Amazon Braket Prize (Top 3)**
- Featured in PennyLane Highlights

QCNNs are quantum analogs of classical convolutional networks, leveraging translationally invariant circuits to classify quantum states efficiently.
