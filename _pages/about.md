I am a physicist-turned-data-scientist currently working as a Predictive Modeling Analyst at The Cincinnati Insurance Company. My work sits at the intersection of machine learning, NLP, and applied statistics — with a focus on homeowner insurance pricing and risk modeling.

Previously, I completed a Ph.D. in Physics at **Virginia Tech** (2018–2023) under Prof. [Uwe C. Täuber](https://www.phys.vt.edu/About/people/faculty/tauber.html), where my research spanned **statistical physics**, **quantum information**, and **quantum walks**. Before that, I earned my B.Sc. in Physics from **Nankai University** (2014–2018).

My broader interests include quantum simulation, reinforcement learning, and the theory of complex systems. I am also an IBM-certified quantum developer and have competed in quantum hackathons (QHack 2024: 3rd place + Amazon Braket Prize).
